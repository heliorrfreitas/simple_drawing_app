# Simple drawing application

This application is just a simple drawing tool. It allows the user to draw in different colors, use an eraser, and download the draw created. In addition, it also has the option to clean the canvas, and change the size of the eraser.

The application works on desktop. I didn't adapt it to work well on mobile.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

You will need a web browser and a text editor.

```
Web browser could be Firefox or Chrome for example.
And the text editor could be Notepad, Atom, Notepad ++, or any other text editor.
```

### Considerations

The application is not perfect. It does not work well on mobile for example. But it is a good starting point if you want to play around with graphics.

In the future I may come back to it to add more features, or even better, I (you) could start a new project and add more features.

## Using the page

Simply open it on your web browser and do some draws, change the color, use the eraser, save, etc.
